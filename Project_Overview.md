# Project Overview: VoxCoinBot

**VoxCoinBot** is a Telegram bot originally developed for a fandom community based on "Hazbin Hotel". It is designed to provide entertainment, social interaction, and light gamification using a custom in-chat economy.

## Key Features

- 🎰 **Casino**: Uses a chat currency ("воксценты") awarded for messages over 10 characters. Encourages meaningful conversation while allowing users to gamble and play.
- 🃏 **UNO & "Nonsence"**: Includes classic UNO gameplay and an experimental "nonsense story" game, collaboratively written by users.
- 🧠 **Markov Chain Neural Net**: Learns from up to 100,000 user messages to generate stylized chat responses.
- 🥚 **Easter Eggs & Roleplay**: Responds to specific trigger phrases with randomized responses; allows custom roleplay "actions" (up to 10k entries).
- 🥇 **Chat Activity Leaderboard**: (Currently broken) Weekly ranking of active users.
- 🎵 **Song & Topic Recommender**: Users can request a random song or topic to discuss, both of which can be expanded by users.
- 💸 **Multi-Currency System**:
  - *Voxcents*: For casino activities.
  - *Voxcoins*: For internal economy (admin salaries, user rewards).
  - *TV-Coins*: For joining Rave sessions.
  - *(Not in this build)* Event currencies themed around the Seven Deadly Sins with separate balances and leaderboards.

## Purpose

Originally created as a fun project for a small community, this bot evolved into a feature-rich demonstration of modular architecture, Telegram API usage, and creative gamification logic.

## Notes

- All bot features are modular.
- Development was done solo and without a formal tracker.
- Intended for educational and portfolio use.
